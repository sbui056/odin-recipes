            <li>1/3 cup water</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon honey</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon grated fresh garlic</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger</li>
            <li>1 pound jumbo shrimp</li>
            <li>1/2 fresh pineapple, cored and cut into 1 Â½-inch pieces</li>
            <li>skewers</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons minced fresh cilantro (Optional)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds (Optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3> Steps to Deliciousness</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine water, soy sauce, brown sugar, honey, garlic, and ginger in a small saucepan and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until sauce has reduced and thickened slightly, 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil grate. Thread shrimp and pineapple alternately onto skewers and place on a platter.</li>
            <li>Arrange skewers on the hot grate. Grill 2 to 3 minutes per side, or until shrimp is opaque and cooked through. Turn grill to low heat and brush sauce on both sides of skewers. Transfer to a serving platter and sprinkle with cilantro and sesame seeds.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>recipe tips</h4>
        <ul>
            <li> Try to cut the pineapple chunks approximately the same size as the shrimp for even grilling.</li>
            <li>I prefer to use jumbo shrimp (21 to 25 per pound), but use what you have on hand.</li>
            <li>If using wooden skewers, soak in water for 30 minutes before using to prevent burning.</li>
            <li>Prep the homemade sauce ahead of time for an even faster dinner.</li>
        </ul>
